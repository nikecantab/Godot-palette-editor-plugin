#Palette Editor

Simple godot plugin for creating and editing color palettes.

Palettes are saved as resource files that store an array of colors. This plugin lets you edit many palettes at once.
Handy for when you want to save palettes but don't want to use PNGs. For smaller palettes, Palette files take less space than external PNG resources as they don't need a .import file. 
Standard Godot does not currently feature passing uniform arrays into shaders, but if future versions add this feature this plugin could help with passing colors into shaders.

###Future
Importing/exporting .pal files would be nice but it is yet to be implemented.
